# rootless WordPress Docker Container

This Dockerfile installs WordPress 6.x, along with the latest (wp-cli)[https://wp-cli.org/] (used to download the WordPress as well), supervisor, nginx 1.24, and PHP-FPM 8.1 (on-demand PM) on Alpine Linux. It's designed as a rootless image, for heavy-load production sites and is currently being used in multiple environments without any issues.

The `wp-config.php` file included in this container is configured to use environmental variables, making management much easier. The nginx configuration has also been heavily tweaked and optimized. Additionally, the container runs a system cron instead of WP cron, as the latter is not very reliable.

Also, it has a script managed by `supervisor` process which copies all data automatically from `/data` and put into `/usr/src/wordpress` if you want to add files to the root folder, like `robots.txt`.

The current image size is around 80 MB, and the goal of this project is to make it even smaller.
